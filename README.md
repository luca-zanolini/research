## About Me

I am a research scientist at the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/) where I focus on the long-term improvements of Ethereumâ€™s consensus protocol. My research is currently centered around [single slot finality for Ethereum](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/single_slot_finality). You can read more about my academic background [here](https://lucazanolini.com).
